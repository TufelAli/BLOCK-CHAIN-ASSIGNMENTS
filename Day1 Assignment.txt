
1) What is your understanding of block chain?
> It is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.Blockchain is a system of recording information in a 
way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of 
transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the 
chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is 
added to every participantâ€™s ledger.


2)what is the core problem block chain trying to solve?
1. Identity Theft
2. Managing And Protecting Patient Data in Health Care Organizations
3. Digital Copyright And Piracy
4. Authenticity
5. Security

3)what are the few features that block chain will give you?
1. Cannot be Corrupted
2. Decentralized Technology
3. Enhanced Security
4. Distributed Ledgers
5. security
6. No hacking

4)What are all the things that a block contains?
block contains:
1. block number
2. Transaction records
3. previous block signature
4. mining key

5)How is verifiablility of block chain attained?
Through the redistribution of tamper proof.
block 1=A(0)+B(data)=C(Fingerprint)
Block 2=C(sign/fingerprint)+d(data)=F(fingerprint)
b and D are the data
each block will get the transaction in every 10 sec
first block is a genesis one which doesn't contain the sign/fingerprint.
